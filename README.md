# Telecom-churn-project

## Aim:

To analyse tele customer churn to find out whether the person is churn or not by Logistic-regression.

## Objectives:
Study the factors which affect the churn. Find out the person has churn or not.Find out the important things. Finally, we can give the business insights and deliver it to the audience.

## Methodology:

Data collection: I have collected the telecustomer churn dataset.

Data Cleaning: In this step we prepare the data for further analysis by removing null values, transforming and standardizing our data.

Exploratory Data Analyis: After cleaning process we study the descriptive statistics, visualize data based on how they are related to each other.

Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model.

Evaluation: After model development we check the Confusion metrics and also checks for the accuracy which produces more accurate results.

## Tools & Technology used:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn,numpy.

## Conclusion:

We have drawn many interesting inferences from the dataset telecustomer churn, hereâ€™s a summary of the few of them.

The gender value of the telecustomer churn has more number of male than female.

The person using internet service through fiber optic ,DSL and few of them not using internet service.

The person has month contract varies from month to month , one year and two year as the value 3875,1473 and 1695.

The churn value for yes is 1869 and value for no is 5174 from the dataset.

The average value for the monthly charges 64.761 , 3923 person using more than monthly charges and 1355 person who turned into churn yes from more than monthly charges.

Then by using machine learning logistic regression model we have finded the 80.26% accuracy.
